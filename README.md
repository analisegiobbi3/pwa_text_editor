  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)
  As a developer, I wanted to create a text editor using PWA that can be used without internet connection.
  
  Acceptance Criteria
    GIVEN a text editor web application
    WHEN I open my application in my editor
    THEN I should see a client server folder structure
    WHEN I run `npm run start` from the root directory
    THEN I find that my application should start up the backend and serve the client
    WHEN I run the text editor application from my terminal
    THEN I find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack
    WHEN I run my webpack plugins
    THEN I find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file
    WHEN I use next-gen JavaScript in my application
    THEN I find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors
    WHEN I open the text editor
    THEN I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage
    WHEN I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window
    THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB
    WHEN I reopen the text editor after closing it
    THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB
    WHEN I click on the Install button
    THEN I download my web application as an icon on my desktop
    WHEN I load my web application
    THEN I should have a registered service worker using workbox
    WHEN I register a service worker
    THEN I should have my static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets
    WHEN I deploy to Heroku
    THEN I should have proper build scripts for a webpack application
